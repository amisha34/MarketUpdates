 <p data-end="562" data-start="87"><strong data-end="118" data-start="87">Iduronate 2 Sulfatase (IDS)</strong>, also known as <strong data-end="173" data-start="134">Alpha L-Iduronate Sulfate Sulfatase</strong> or <strong data-end="192" data-start="177">Idursulfase</strong>, is an enzyme essential for the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) like dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. It is encoded by the <strong data-end="340" data-start="328">IDS gene</strong>, and its deficiency leads to a condition known as <strong data-end="410" data-start="391">Hunter Syndrome</strong> (or <strong data-end="443" data-start="415">Mucopolysaccharidosis II</strong>), a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of GAGs in tissues and organs, causing progressive damage.</p>

 <p data-end="1101" data-start="564">In medical terms, <strong data-end="613" data-start="582">Iduronate 2 Sulfatase (IDS)</strong> is used in <strong data-end="661" data-start="625">enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)</strong> for treating <strong data-end="694" data-start="675">Hunter Syndrome</strong>. The condition affects both males and females, although it is far more common in males due to its X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. The development and approval of treatments that provide functional IDS are crucial for managing this disorder, and the ongoing research in this space has paved the way for promising therapies that are designed to replace or supplement the deficient enzyme in patients.</p>
