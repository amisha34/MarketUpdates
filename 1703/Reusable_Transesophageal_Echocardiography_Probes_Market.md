 <p>Transesophageal ultrasound transducers are used as an alternate way to perform a heart scan. A narrow probe with a specialized tip is inserted into the patient?s esophagus and provides life-saving imagery and Doppler evaluation of the heart and the arteries around it. Doctors often use this option, known as an echocardiogram, when they want a more detailed image the sound waves can produce than the images obtained using a standard EKG.</p>
