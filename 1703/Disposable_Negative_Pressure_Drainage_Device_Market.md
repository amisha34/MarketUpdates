 <p>The disposable negative pressure drainage device is a medical device used to remove excess liquid or air from a wound or surgical site. It is designed to create a negative pressure (suction) around the wound, helping to remove excess fluid and promote healing. The device typically consists of a small portable pump connected to a drain pipe and collection tank. A drainage tube is inserted into the wound or surgical site, and the pump creates negative pressure around the site, helping to remove excess fluid and promote healing. The fluid is then collected in a tank and disposed of safely. The disposable negative pressure drainage device is usually used after surgery or to treat wounds, such as pressure ulcers or diabetes foot ulcers. They can help reduce the risk of infection, promote healing, and improve the prognosis of patients.</p>
