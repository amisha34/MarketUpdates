 <p>Interventional Pulmonology uses non-surgical, minimally invasive procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, thoracic cancer, tracheal cancer, and other diseases related to the respiratory system. It relies on endoscopic techniques, which involve inserting an instrument into the human body to view internal organs and tissues and to conduct additional procedures. Interventional pulmonary medicine is also used to treat related symptoms that may cause discomfort, such as shortness of breath, coughing, and chest pain.Interventional pulmonology has revolutionized the field of pulmonary (related to the lungs and breathing) medicine by providing the most advanced minimally invasive procedures to diagnose and treat both malignant and non-malignant disorders of the lungs and airways. Procedures for interventional pulmonology include: <strong>Bronchoscopes</strong>, <strong>Pleuroscopes</strong>, Respiratory Endotherapy Devices (Aspiration Needles, Biopsy Forceps, Biopsy brush, Biopsy Needles, pulmonary catheter, balloon dilatation catheter), Airway Stents, Pleural Catheters, Endobronchial Valves, Bronchial Thermoplasty Systems, Tracheotomy Tube, etc. n terms of product type, <strong>bronchoscope</strong> and IP therapy equipment are the top two subdivisions, accounting for about 53% of the share. It is the most used in hospitals and clinics, accounting for 60.68% of the total.</p>
