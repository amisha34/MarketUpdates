 <p>Low volume polysulfone dialyzer is a type of dialyzer that is designed to be used in hemodialysis treatments with a smaller amount of blood. Polysulfone is a type of polymer that is used to make the dialyzer membrane in low volume polysulfone dialyzers. The membrane is a semi-permeable barrier that allows waste products and excess fluids to pass through, while retaining essential blood components such as red blood cells and proteins. These dialyzers have a lower blood volume capacity compared to standard dialyzers, typically ranging from 150 to 350 ml, which makes them suitable for patients with lower blood volumes, such as children or elderly patients.</p>
