 <p>Transesophageal ultrasound transducers are used as an alternate way to perform a heart scan. A narrow probe with a specialized tip is inserted into the patient?s esophagus and provides life-saving imagery and Doppler evaluation of the heart and the arteries around it. Doctors often use this option, known as an echocardiogram, when they want a more detailed image the sound waves can produce than the images obtained using a standard EKG. Transesophageal Echocardiography Probe can be reused after Disinfection.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The art of disinfecting transesophagael (TEE) ultrasound probes is very different and challenging when compared to other endocavity probes, i.e. a <strong>colonoscope</strong> or <strong>gastroscope</strong>. The industry, for years, has categorized TEE probes as an <strong>endoscope</strong>. The similarities of TEE probes to <strong>endoscopes</strong> are minor. Take the <strong>colonoscope</strong> and <strong>gastroscope</strong>, they are similar in length to the TEE probe but that is the only similarity. To properly reprocess a TEE ultrasound probe the technician should be aware of the delicate nature of the various components. A critical difference between the <strong>colonoscope</strong> and <strong>gastroscope</strong> is that the TEE probe can?t be completely submerged into the rinse and high-level disinfectant bathes. The TEE ultrasound probe is not water tight and the complete submersion of the probe could cause serious damage and result in the probes inoperability. A thorough understanding of the TEE ultrasound probe, of how it can and should be reprocessed, is critical. This knowledge will lead to minimized TEE ultrasound probe damage, improved patient outcome and allow for proper reprocessing that will minimize HAIs.</p>
