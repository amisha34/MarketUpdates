<h1>Human Gut Chip Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><br/><p>Report Overview</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Human Gut Chip is a biosimulation technology designed to simulate the structure and function of the human intestine, usually implemented on a microfluidic chip or microbial chip. This technology uses tissue engineering and biotechnology to plant artificially cultured intestinal cells on a chip to simulate various characteristics of the real intestine, such as mucosal layer, intestinal peristalsis, intestinal flora, etc. Human gut chips can be used to simulate the digestive process, absorb and transport substances, study the pathogenesis of intestinal diseases, and evaluate the absorption, toxicity and efficacy of drugs. This technology provides a highly controllable and reproducible experimental platform for intestinal-related research, helps understand intestinal physiology and pathology, and accelerates the development and evaluation of new drugs.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The global Human Gut Chip market size was estimated at USD 736 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 3365.45 million by 2032, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 18.40% during the forecast period.</p>
