 <p>Hydrotherapy refers to the use of water for therapeutic purposes. It is a form of physical therapy that involves exercises and movements performed in water, typically in a pool or tank. Hydrotherapy is often used to treat a variety of conditions, including arthritis, back pain, and joint injuries. Aquatic therapy is a type of hydrotherapy that specifically involves exercises and movements performed in water for rehabilitation or therapeutic purposes. It is often used for individuals who have difficulty performing land-based exercises due to pain or mobility limitations. Aquatic therapy can also be beneficial for individuals recovering from surgeries, such as joint replacements. Hydrotherapy can be classified into various types, including chambers, whirlpool baths, and hydrotherapy tanks. Chambers refer to sealed environments where pressure and temperature can be controlled, typically used for treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Whirlpool baths use jets of water to provide massage and stimulation to specific areas of the body. Hydrotherapy tanks are large, specialized pools used for aquatic therapy and rehabilitation.</p>
