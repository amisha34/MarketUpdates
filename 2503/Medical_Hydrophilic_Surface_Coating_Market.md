 <p>Hydrophilic coating technologies make polymeric devices susceptible to fluids by grafting polymers into covalent bonds to create water-attracting surfaces. The lubricity and water retention characteristics reduce the force required to manipulate intravascular medical devices during interventional procedures. They can decrease the frictional force between devices 10- to 100-fold and help reduce risk of damage to blood vessel walls, prevent vasospasm, and allow navigation in tortuous vascular pathways and lesions inaccessible to uncoated devices. Hydrophilic coatings have expanded the range of treatment sites for procedures such as balloon catheter angioplasty, neurological interventions, lesion crossing, and site-delivered drug therapies while reducing thrombogenicity. Reduced friction between therapy and support catheters has improved outcomes and reduced procedure time and cost.</p>
