 <p>Biochemistry analyzer is used in laboratories to measure chemicals in biological samples. It focuses on analytes such as drugs of abuse, specific proteins, electrolytes, and enzyme, and metabolite tests for liver, cardiac, and renal function. Biochemical analyzer is made of an optical engine that comprises detectors, light sources, and other optical elements, sample movement, automation control and processing, environmental monitoring, power management, and control for humidity, pressure, and temperature. Highly automated biochemical analyzers, which include automated sample loading, mechanical control, data processing and tube cleaning have greater efficiency. Fully automatic analyzer, which is a high performance biochemistry analyzer, is used to measure various blood biochemical parameters such as urea, glucose, and bilirubin that are associated with various disorders such as kidney diseases, diabetes, liver failures, and other metabolic imbalances. Some analyzers are also used to detect DNA molecules in the samples.</p>
