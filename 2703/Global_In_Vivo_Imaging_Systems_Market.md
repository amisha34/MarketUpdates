<h1>Global In Vivo Imaging Systems Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><br/><p>Report Overview:</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Small animal living body imaging technology refers to the application of imaging methods to carry out qualitative and quantitative research on biological processes at the tissue, cell and molecular levels in the living state. In vivo imaging is one of the techniques for long-term longitudinal study of animals without damaging them. Imaging technology can provide absolute quantitative and relative quantitative data. It changes according to its position in the sample. This kind of technology provides absolute quantitative information, such as CT, MRI and pet; Image data signals are sample position dependent, such as bioluminescence, fluorescence and multiphoton microscopy in visible light imaging, which belong to the category of relative quantification, but can be quantified by strictly designing experiments</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The Global In Vivo Imaging Systems Market Size was estimated at USD 116.31 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 139.69 million by 2029, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 3.10% during the forecast period.</p>
