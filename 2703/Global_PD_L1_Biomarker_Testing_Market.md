<h1>Global PD-L1 Biomarker Testing Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><br/><p>Report Overview:</p>
 
 
 
 <p>PD-L1 Biomarker Testing measures the amount of PDL1 on cancer cells. PDL1 is a protein that helps keep immune cells from attacking nonharmful cells in the body. Normally, the immune system fights foreign substances like viruses and bacteria, and not your own healthy cells. Some cancer cells have high amounts of PDL1. This allows the cancer cells to "trick" the immune system, and avoid being attacked as foreign, harmful substances.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Current PD-L1 testing is based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the process whereby antibodies are used to detect proteins (antigens) in cells within a tissue section (for instance liver, pancreas or the heart).</p>

 <p>PD-L1 is a ligand that binds to PD-1 (programmed cell death-1), expressed on activated T cells, to evade anti-tumor responses. PD-L1 plays a role in inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation and has emerged as an important target in cancer treatment. PD-L1 protein detection by immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing is widely used as a predictive biomarker assay for anti?PD-1/PD-L1 therapies.</p>
