<h1>Global Carotid Stents Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><br/><p>Report Overview:</p>
 
 
 
 <p>Carotid artery stenting is a procedure used to open a narrowed carotid artery in the heart. It involves placing a small, expandable or non-expandable tube called stent in the artery. The carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedure is also known as carotid angioplasty. Stenting helps in preventing a stroke in the long term, whereas it increases the risk of stroke and death in the short term. Carotid artery stenting is an optional procedure, which can be used if a patient has more than 60% to 70% narrowing and has low risk of serious problems from stenting. Carotid stents are available in different sizes and shapes in order to be used for patients with major heart problems. Carotid stents also feature few characteristics which makes these more useful devices for a heart surgeon. Characteristics such as visibility of stents under X-ray, scaffolding design for more effective drug elution and easier deliverability, and conformity of the stent struts to the vessel walls increase the safety and efficacy of these devices. However, new developments in stents technology are paving the way for earlier diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The Global Carotid Stents Market Size was estimated at USD 1873.58 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 3247.41 million by 2029, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 9.60% during the forecast period.</p>
