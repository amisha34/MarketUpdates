<h1>Global Embolization Coil Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><br/><p>Report Overview:</p>
 
 
 
 <p>An Embolization Coil is a device that is used to block blood flow to an abnormal area in a blood vessel, such as an aneurysm or an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). An aneurysm is a bulge or a weak spot in the wall of an artery that can rupture and cause bleeding. An AVM is a tangle of abnormal blood vessels that can also bleed or press on nearby tissues. By blocking the blood flow, an Embolization Coil can prevent bleeding, reduce pressure, or shrink the abnormal area. Embolization Coils are made of soft metal wires that are shaped like springs. They can be either detachable or pushable, depending on how they are delivered and released into the blood vessel. Embolization Coils are inserted through a thin tube called a catheter that is guided by X-ray images to the target site.</p>
 
 
 
 <p>The Global Embolization Coil Market Size was estimated at USD 1287.79 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 1583.02 million by 2029, exhibiting a <strong>CAGR</strong> of 3.50% during the forecast period.</p>
