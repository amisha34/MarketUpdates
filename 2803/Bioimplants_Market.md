 <p>Increasing geriatric population base and rising incidences of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, neuropathic (Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s disease) and congenital diseases are the vital drivers for this market. Advanced technologies including 3D printing, laser technology and nanotechnology deployed to manufacture bio implants significantly enhance their biocompatibility, therefore, is expected to fuel the market growth during the forecast period. Bio implants includes biological implants (cell therapy, tissue engineering), biologised implants (technical implants, In-vivo cell lining) and bio functionalized implants (drug eluting stents). North America was the largest market, followed by Europe, and Asia. The U.S. market is expected to face a slump in the coming years due to austerity measures taken by the Federal Government and rise in taxation caused due to the economic crisis of 2008. Uncertainty also prevails in the European region with the Euro crisis; hence, growth is expected to be minimal in this region for the next five years. Asia, however, will showcase higher growth mainly due to large investments from foreign firms and government funding.</p>
