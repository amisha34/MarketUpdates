 <p>Protein purification employs multiple chromatography techniques that separate products according to differences of their properties. Chromatography is a technique to separate, identify, and purify molecules for quantitative and qualitative analysis. In chromatography, molecules in a mixture of substances separate with the use of adsorbents. The principle of column chromatography is to separate a large pool of proteins into many smaller pools, some of which are enriched in the protein of interest. While expensive and specialized equipment is available for column chromatography, only basic equipment is required.</p>
