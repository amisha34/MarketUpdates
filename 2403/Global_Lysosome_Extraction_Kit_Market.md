 <p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p>
 
 
 
 <p>Lysosome is a vesicular structure surrounded by a unit membrane and contains a variety of acid hydrolases. Lysosomes contain more than 40 kinds of hydrolytic enzymes, including proteases, nucleic acid degrading enzymes and glycosidases. Its main function is the digestion of intracellular substances. In addition, lysosomes are closely related to the formation of organs, the regulation of hormone secretion and the occurrence of some diseases. Lysosome Extraction Kit can be used for lysosome extraction of various animal cells and solid soft and hard tissue samples. The extracted lysosomes are biologically active and can be used in various downstream applications such as lysosomal function research, lysosomal staining, and lysosomal protein extraction.</p>
