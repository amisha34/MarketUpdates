This is the transparent, delicate tissue that encircles the eye's white region (sclera). Pinguecula word is derived from the Latin word pinguis, which means "fat" or "grease." The growth occurs in the part of the conjunctiva that is exposed when the eye is open. The risk factors for the progression of pinguecula include exposure to ultraviolet light, trauma, wind, dust and sand, working outdoors for a long duration and advancing age. Individuals having a history of elevated UV exposure and those living closer to the equator have a higher incidence (outdoor work). According to certain research, males have a somewhat higher incidence than females, which could simply be due to a higher rate of UV exposure. It appears as a tiny, yellowish bump on the conjunctiva close to the cornea. It may emerge on either side of the cornea.</p><p>This report aims to provide a comprehensive presentation of the global market for Pingueculum Drugs, with both quantitative and qualitative analysis, to help readers develop business/growth strategies, assess the market competitive situation, analyze their position in the current marketplace, and make informed business decisions regarding Pingueculum Drugs.
