Clinical Oncology Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is an advanced genomic technology used to analyze the genetic makeup of cancer cells. NGS allows for comprehensive analysis of various genetic variants, including single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertions, deletions, exon duplications, gene copy number changes, and translocations. The key advantage of NGS lies in its ability to analyze large volumes of genetic data quickly and accurately, providing valuable insights into cancer's molecular mechanisms, enabling better diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions. This technology is a key component in personalized cancer therapy, offering the potential for more targeted and effective treatments based on an individual’s unique genetic profile.
