Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging is a medical imaging technique that employs near-infrared (NIR) light to capture images of tissue and structures inside the human body. This method uses fluorescence imaging agents that can be excited by NIR light (typically with wavelengths greater than 760 nm). These agents, when exposed to NIR light, emit fluorescence, allowing the visualization of tissue deposition, enabling surgeons to detect abnormalities and guide surgical interventions. NIRF imaging has been gaining popularity for its non-invasive, high-precision capabilities in real-time during various surgeries, such as cardiovascular surgery, cancer surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, and plastic and reconstructive surgery.



The market for NIRF imaging devices has witnessed considerable growth, driven by increasing adoption in clinical settings, improvements in imaging technologies, and rising demand for precision medicine. The ability of NIRF imaging to enhance visualization and surgical outcomes makes it a preferred choice in complex surgical procedures.
