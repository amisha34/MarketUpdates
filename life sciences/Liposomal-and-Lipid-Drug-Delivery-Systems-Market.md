Liposomal and lipid drug delivery systems are cutting-edge technologies that utilize nanoparticles to target and release therapeutic agents in a controlled manner. These drug delivery systems offer several advantages over traditional methods, including reduced side effects, minimized drug dosages, and less frequent administration. Liposomes, which are spherical vesicles composed of lipid bilayers, serve as carriers for drugs, providing efficient encapsulation, protection, and release of active ingredients to target tissues. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), another prominent drug delivery system, are utilized to enhance the solubility and stability of drugs, thereby improving bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. Both systems have gained significant attention due to their potential to revolutionize drug administration, particularly in cancer therapy, gene delivery, and vaccines.
