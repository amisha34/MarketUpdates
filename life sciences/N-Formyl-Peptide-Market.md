N-formyl peptides are a class of peptides that contain an N-formyl group at the N-terminus. This modification involves the attachment of a formyl group (–CHO) to the nitrogen atom of the peptide’s amino terminus, creating a unique structure that impacts the peptide’s biochemical properties. N-formylation occurs through enzymatic reactions and plays a significant role in regulating the biological function of peptides. By altering the peptide's stability, hydrophilicity, and reactivity, the formylation process can enhance or suppress certain biological processes.



In a biological context, N-formyl peptides are particularly relevant because they serve as signals for immune cells, playing a crucial role in processes such as inflammation and immune response. The presence of N-formyl peptides can signal the presence of infection or injury, leading to an immune system response, making these peptides valuable for therapeutic applications, particularly in immunology.
