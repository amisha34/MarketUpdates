N-acetyl Cysteine (NAC) is a powerful antioxidant and a form of the amino acid cysteine, which is a precursor for the production of glutathione, a vital molecule in the body known for its detoxification properties. NAC plays a critical role in combating oxidative stress caused by harmful free radicals, which can damage cells and lead to various health issues. As a supplement, NAC has gained significant attention due to its therapeutic potential in treating various diseases such as chronic respiratory conditions, liver disorders, and mental health issues.



NAC is available in various forms, including oral capsules, tablets, and topical formulations, making it versatile for a wide range of applications. Its medicinal benefits also extend to its use as a mucolytic agent, helping to break down mucus in the lungs and improve respiratory function. In recent years, NAC has also become popular in the wellness industry as a dietary supplement due to its antioxidant properties.
