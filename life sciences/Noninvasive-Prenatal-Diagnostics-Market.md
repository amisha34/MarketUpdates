Noninvasive Prenatal Diagnostics (NIPD) refers to advanced medical technologies and procedures used to detect chromosomal disorders in fetuses without posing risks associated with traditional invasive testing methods. These diagnostics can identify a variety of genetic conditions, including Down's syndrome, Edwards syndrome, Turner syndrome, and Patau syndrome, by analyzing cell-free fetal DNA present in the maternal bloodstream. NIPD has gained widespread acceptance due to its safety, accuracy, and noninvasiveness.
