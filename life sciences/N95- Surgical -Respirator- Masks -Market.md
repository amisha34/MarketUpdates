N95 Surgical Respirator Masks, or Surgical N95 respirators, are highly specialized protective masks widely used in healthcare settings. These masks are a part of the N95 category of filtering facepiece respirators, which are designed to provide a secure fit and offer high filtration efficiency. N95 masks are engineered to filter out at least 95% of airborne particles, making them highly effective in preventing the inhalation of harmful particles, including bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. The tight fit of these masks, coupled with their synthetic material composed of electrostatically charged microfibers, allows for superior protection compared to regular surgical masks.



KN95 masks, which are the Chinese counterparts to the N95 respirators, adhere to the same filtration standard, ensuring a similar level of protection. These masks have gained significant attention in the global market, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they are crucial for preventing airborne transmission of infectious diseases in high-risk environments like hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities.
