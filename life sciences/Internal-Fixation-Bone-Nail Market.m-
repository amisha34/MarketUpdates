The global Internal Fixation Bone Nail market revolves around intramedullary (IM) devices—long cylindrical implants crafted from surgical-grade stainless steel or titanium. These devices are meticulously designed to stabilize fractures by being inserted into the marrow cavity of long bones such as the tibia, femur, humerus, or forearm bones. Renowned for their durability and biocompatibility, these nails are pivotal in orthopedic surgeries aimed at restoring skeletal integrity and function.
