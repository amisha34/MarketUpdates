N-Butyl cyanoacrylate (n-BCA, NBCA) is a cyanoacrylate ester that serves as the butyl ester of 2-cyano-2-propenoic acid. It is a clear, colorless liquid with a sharp and irritating odor. Insoluble in water, n-BCA is primarily used as the main component in medical cyanoacrylate adhesives. These adhesives are widely recognized for their quick-setting properties and effectiveness in surgical applications, particularly in wound closure, tissue bonding, and sealing.
