The Nanoliposomal Lutein market focuses on advanced nanotechnology-based formulations where lutein, a vital carotenoid, is encapsulated in nanoliposomes. These nanocarriers, with particle sizes smaller than 30nm, significantly improve the absorption efficiency and bioavailability of lutein. This encapsulation not only ensures steady and effective delivery but also enhances the antioxidant and protective benefits of lutein, particularly for eye health and anti-aging applications.
