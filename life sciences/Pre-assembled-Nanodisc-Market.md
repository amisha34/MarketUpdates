Pre-assembled nanodiscs are small, disc-shaped structures ranging from 7 to 50 nanometers in diameter. These nanodiscs consist of a phospholipid bilayer stabilized by membrane scaffold proteins (MSP) or synthetic polymers. Due to their structural and functional properties, nanodiscs are widely utilized in proteomics and biomedicine, offering a versatile platform for studying membrane proteins, drug delivery, and therapeutic applications. By providing a near-native lipid environment, nanodiscs are particularly suited for the structural and functional analysis of integral membrane proteins and their interactions.
