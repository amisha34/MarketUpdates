Nephrostomy Balloon Catheters are specialized medical devices used during percutaneous renal procedures to dilate the muscles, fascia, and renal capsule, creating a tract between the skin and kidney. This tract facilitates access for further procedures such as stone removal or drainage of the kidney. These catheters play a critical role in urological surgeries, ensuring precision and minimizing patient discomfort during interventions.
