The Peripheral Nerve Repair and Regeneration market focuses on solutions for treating damaged peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves are those outside the brain and spinal cord, connecting to muscles and organs. Damage to these nerves, which can occur due to traumatic injury, surgery, or medical conditions, disrupts signals to the brain and hinders normal function. To restore function, medical procedures are required, often involving nerve grafts, conduits, and wraps to promote nerve healing.



This market encompasses devices, technologies, and therapies designed to restore or repair peripheral nerves. It includes advancements in biological materials, neurostimulation, and tissue engineering. The goal of these treatments is to enhance the recovery of lost functionality, offering patients improved mobility and quality of life.
