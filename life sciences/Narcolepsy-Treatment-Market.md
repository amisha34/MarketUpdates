Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that results in extreme daytime sleepiness, often leading to sudden sleep attacks and affecting a person’s ability to stay awake. Common symptoms of narcolepsy include excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle strength), hypnagogic hallucinations (vivid, dream-like experiences), and sleep paralysis. The narcolepsy treatment market revolves around the provision of medical treatments and therapies to manage these symptoms and improve patients' quality of life.



The global narcolepsy treatment market consists of drugs and therapies that help control symptoms such as EDS, cataplexy, and other disruptions caused by the disorder. Key treatment approaches involve the use of sodium oxybate, central nervous system stimulants, and antidepressants, among others.
